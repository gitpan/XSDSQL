Schema Elements

	all Nested elements can appear in any order. Each child element is
	   optional, and can occur no more than one time.


	annotation Schema comments. Contains appInfo and documentation.
		  appInfo: Information for parsing and destination applications - must
		 be a child of annotation.
		documentation: Schema text comments; must be a child of
	       annotation.


	any Any type of well-formed XML can be nested under the any element,
	   in any order. Same as the DTD <!ELEMENT element_name ANY >
	  declaration.


	anyAttribute Any attributes composed of well-formed XML can be nested under
		    the anyAttribute element, in any order.


	attribute An attribute.


	attributeGroup Reusable attribute group for complex type definitions.


	choice A list of choices, one of which must be chosen. Same as using the
	      vertical bar character (|) in a DTD choice list.


	complexContent Definition of mixed content or elements in a complex type.


	complexType Complex type element.


	element Element element.


	extension Extends a simpleType or complexType.



	field An element or attribute that is referenced for a constraint. Similar to
	     the DTD IDREF attribute data type, but uses an XPATH expression for
	    the reference.


	group A group of elements for complex type definitions.


	import Imports external Schemas with different Namespaces.


	include Includes external Schemas with the same Namespace.


	key Defines a nested attribute or element as a unique key. Same as the

	keyref Refers to a key element. Same as the DTD IDREF attribute data type.


	list A list of values in a simple type element.


	notation Defines the format of non-parsed data within an XML document.
		Same as the DTD NOTATION attribute data type.


	restriction Imposes restrictions on a simpleType, simpleContent, or a
		   complexContent element.


	schema The root element of every W3C Schema document.


	selector Groups a set of elements for identity constraints using an XPath
		expression.


	sequence Specifies a strict order on child elements. Same as using the comma
		to separate nested elements in a DTD sequence.


	simpleContent Definition of text-only content in a simple type.


	simpleType Declares a simple type definition.


	union Groups simple types into a single union of values.


	unique Defines an element or an attribute as unique at a specified nesting
	      level in the document.

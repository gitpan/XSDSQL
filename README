blx::xsdsql
==========================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL [PREFIX=<dir>]
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other perl modules and external programs

    XML::Parser             => '1.21' 
    XML::Writer             => '0.600'
    DBI                     => '1.58'
    Carp::Assert            => '0.20'
    Attribute::Constant     => '0.06'
    DBD::DBM                => '0.06' (if it's use DBM or run the test suite with default database)
    MLDBM                   => '2.05' (if it's use DBM or run the test suite with default database)
    SQL::Statement          => '1.33' (if it's use DBM or run the test suite with default database)
    DBD::mysql              => '4.0.20' (if it's use mysql)
    DBD::Oracle             => '1.44'   (if it's use oracle)
    DBD::Pg                 => '2.19.0' (if it's use postgresql)
    xmllint                     if run the testsuite
    xmldiff                     if run the testsuite
    
The database supported is oracle,postgresql,mysql and DBM 
Other databases is possible in future versions

The minimum perl version supported is 5.10 

After the installation the directory $PREFIX/bin contain the programs:
    xml_repo.pl for manage repository,schemas and xml
    xsd2sql.pl - for drop or construct repository and schema catalog manually
                 this program produce a sql files to run with the appropriate database client
                 or alternatively with the isql.pl in tools directory
                 
    


Test with other databases:
if you want a complete tests with one or more databases the steps are:
  install the DBD driver of the appropriate database
  set the enviroment variable XSDSQL_<dbname> with <dbname>::= DBM|ORA|PG|MYSQL and export it
  exec testall.pl in t directory 
  
  
  this examples are for the bash shell:
  
  postgres: export XSDSQL_PG='sql::pg:myuser/mypwd@mydb:127.0.0.1:5432;RaiseError => 1,AutoCommit => 0,pg_enable_utf8 => 1'
  mysql:    export XSDSQL_MYSQL='sql::mysql:myuser/mypwd@mydb:127.0.0.1:3306;RaiseError => 1,AutoCommit => 0,mysql_enable_utf8 => 1'
  dbm:      export XSDSQL_DBM='sql::DBM:dbm_mldbm=Storable;RaiseError => 1,f_dir=> q(/tmp)'
  oracle:   export XSDSQL_ORA='sql::oracle:myuser/mypwd@orcl:127.0.0.1:1522;RaiseError => 1,AutoCommit => 0'
            export NLS_LANG='AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8' # set the utf8 on the client

  WARNING: the databases must support utf8 
  
  
  The format of connection string is:
   [<output_namespace>::]<dbtype>:<user>/<password>@<dbname>[:hostname[:port]][;<attribute>[,<attribute>...]]
   
         <output_namespace>::=  sql  (this is the default)
         <dbtype>::= pg|mysql|oracle|DBM
         <user>::=  username 
         <pwd>::=   password
         <dbname> ::= database name
         <hostname>:: socket remote hostname or ipaddress - the default is 127.0.0.1
         <port>    :: socket remote port - the default is the database port default 
         <attribute> :: extra attribute - see the manual of DBI, section connect 
         
    example of run in bash shell:
         cd t && ./testall.pl > logfile.log 2>&1
